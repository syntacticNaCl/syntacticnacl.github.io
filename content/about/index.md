Hi, my name is Garrett. I am passionate about the topics of cryptography, privacy, and blockchain technologies and their practical applications in todayâ€™s technology infused world. In my free time, I enjoy playing various table-top games, reading, playing guitar and mandolin, hiking, perusing whitepapers, and playing with obscure *nix operating systems.
